BIT MANIPULATION 

This is a project that explains the use of the bitwise operators through the intensive codes implemented in i

It contains the following 

binary_to_uint - Converting a binary number to an unsigned int
void print_binary - Prints the binary perresentation of a number
int get_bit - returns the value of a bit at a given index
int set_bit -  sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
int clear_bit - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
unsigned int flip_bits - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
int get_endianness - int get_endianness
